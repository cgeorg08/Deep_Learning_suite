# Deep_Learning_suite

This repository is related to Deep Learning. There are projects which are simpler, whereas other are more advanced and complex. For the time being you can see the following projects:
- **XOR problem**: building our own neural network from scratch to solve the XOR problem using two different languages: Java and Python.
- **Digit recognition problems**: building our own neural networks from scratch to solve the digit recognision problem by obtaining data in different formats and using two different languages: Java and Python.
