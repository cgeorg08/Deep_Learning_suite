# Digit recognition problems

This repository contains two small problems associated with the digit-recognition problem. See their description below.

- <u>Problem 1:</u> Multi-class perceptron (deep learning exercise 1.2): Implementation of a multi-class perceptron training algorithm (from scratch). Model contains a single layer perceptron with 10 nodes (one per digit), each node having 256+1 inputs (inputs and bias) and 1 output. We train the network on the train set and evaluate on both the train and the test set.
- <u>Problem 2:</u> bachelor askisi 2
- <u>Problem 3:</u> use existing libraries
